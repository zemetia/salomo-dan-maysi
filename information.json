    "how_we_met": "It began with a chance encounter at a quiet café. A shared table led to a conversation that hasn't ended since. From virtual battlefields to real-world sunsets, we’ve learned that home isn't a place, but a person. Our journey has been a tapestry of laughter, challenges, and unwavering support. Today, we stand on the threshold of our greatest adventure yet, and we are so honored to share the beginning of our 'forever' with you."
